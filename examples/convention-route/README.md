# convention-route

In Umi, all pages are of different composed components. The switching of pages is actually the switching of different components. You only need to associate different routing paths with corresponding components in the configuration.

## How to use

Execute [`@umijs/create-umi-app`](https://github.com/umijs/umi/tree/master/packages/create-umi-app) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
npx @umijs/create-umi-app --example convention-route convention-route-app
# or
yarn create @umijs/umi-app --example convention-route convention-route-app
```
